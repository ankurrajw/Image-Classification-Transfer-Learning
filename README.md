# Image-Classification-Transfer-Learning
Image Classification based on Transfer Learning(Pytorch)

Code to help in classification of Images. RESNET 18 model was used for classification. 
More dataset was created with the help of PIL library in Python. Transformation like rotation, grayscaling, horizontal flipping was used.
